This project provides a javascript library for manipulating DOM tables.

You can apply sort, filter and hide to the table or any of its columns. You can also get the unique values within a column. Column data types are calculated in an extensible way. Cells can be set to editable, for use by a GUI.

The library respects HTML semantics (such as THEAD and TFOOT) and creates just one global object - jTable.

The project Wiki contains a basic [introduction](Introduction.md) plus a detailed API for the three members of the jTable object - [jTable.t](jTable_t.md), [jTable.h](jTable_h.md), and [jTable.c](jTable_c.md).
